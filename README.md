# Analysis-of-ZP-and-CP-OFDM-Systems

* This work analyzes the bit error rate (BER) and the mean square error (MSE) of 4 kinds of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, 2 kinds of ZP-OFDM and 2 kinds of CP-OFDM with the zero forcing (ZF) and minimized mean square error (MMSE) receiver, respectively.
